# homebrew-tap

This is the official Homebrew tap for installing [`git-flow-next`](https://github.com/gittower/git-flow-next) â€” a modern, Go-based reimplementation of the Git Flow branching model.

## What is git-flow-next?

`git-flow-next` is a CLI tool that manages Git workflows using the branching model popularized by the original [git-flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) and [git-flow-avh](https://github.com/petervanderdoes/gitflow-avh). This project reimplements the model in Go, providing faster performance, better integration, and extensibility.

brew install gittower/tap/git-flow-next
